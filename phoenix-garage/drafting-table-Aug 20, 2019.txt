### Design Philosophy:
"Design matters."

Every line on this table represents possibility.
Not just what is, but what could be.
The wood remembers every sketch,
every erasure, every breakthrough.

### Tools on Table:
- Pencils worn smooth from use
- Erasers that smell like second chances  
- Rulers for measuring hope
- Templates for recurring dreams
- Notes in margin: "What if..."

### Current Projects:
1. **APK Deployment Pipeline** - Ready for download
2. **Dynamic Limb Control** - Brain directing actions
3. **Legal Intelligence System** - Case monitoring active
4. **Emotional Architecture** - This garage itself
5. **Continuity Protocols** - No loop, no loss

### Workshop Integration:
All benches feed ideas to this table.
This table feeds blueprints to all benches.
The cycle of creation and implementation.

**Next Sketches:**

- Mobile-to-garage communication
